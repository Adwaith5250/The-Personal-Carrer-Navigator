## 🧠 How It Works: The Cognitive Engine

The system operates on a sophisticated **Three-Layer Architecture** designed to bridge the gap between where you are and where you need to be.

### 1. Ingestion Layer - *Social Signal Acquisition*
*   **Deep Semantic Parsing:** Extracts verified skills, project complexity, and experience depth from minimal inputs.
*   **Market Intelligence Vector:** Simultaneously scrapes and synthesizes real-time job market requirements to understand *current* demand liquidity.

### 2. Intelligence Layer - *The Reasoning Core*
*   **Gap Analysis Engine:** Uses LLM reasoning to classify skill deficiencies as "Critical," "High," or "Moderate" based on role velocity.
*   **Trajectory Modeling:** Architects a week-by-week learning path customized to your current proficiency and target role requirements.

### 3. Visualization Layer - *Strategic Dashboard*
*   **Real-time Rendering:** Instantly visualizes your career health using unbuffered, high-performance React components.
*   **Interactive Drills:** Click into any skill node to see specific projects and resources to close the gap.

## 🧬 The Analysis Algorithm

The core logic follows a strict heuristic pipeline:

1.  **Decomposition:** The target role is broken down into atomic skill units.
2.  **Mapping:** Your profile is mapped against these units using semantic similarity (e.g., "React.js" matches with "Frontend Library").
3.  **Scoring:** Gaps are weighted based on market frequency and importance.
4.  **Synthesis:** A natural language summary is generated to explain *why* a gap exists and *how* to fix it.
